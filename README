Sharp UI is a control building framework for Script# and jQuery.

The goal of the project is to replicate the kind of reusability and encapsulation
that one would get using a library such as WPF, Java Swing, or WinForms, 
when building user interface controls.

Features include:
 * Locally-scoped CSS and CSS rewriting.
 * Locally-scoped element IDs and ID rewriting.
 * Auto field population (matching local ID's to field names).
 * Nested declarations -- controls that hold instances of other controls.
 * AddedToDocument/RemovedFromDocument events.
