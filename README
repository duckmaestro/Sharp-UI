Sharp UI is a control building framework for Script# and jQuery.

The goal of the project is to replicate basic reusability and encapsulation
(a la the "user control" paradigm in WPF or ASP.NET) when building 
user interface controls in Script# with jQuery.

Features include:
 * Ability to construct reusable controls using
   HTML fragments and C# (Script#) codebehind.
 * Ability to separate logic from layout by using .html(.cs) file pairs
   and partial classes.
 * Support for locally-scoped CSS through CSS rewriting.
 * Support for locally-identified elements through ID rewriting.
 * Automatic binding of member fields to named elements.
 * Support for nested instantiations -- controls can declare instances of other controls.
 * Support for container controls and preservation of nested/inner content.
 * AddedToDocument & RemovedFromDocument events.
 * Replication of standard "mouse capture" behavior.

Detailed documentation is pending. In the mean time please inspect the example
