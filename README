Sharp UI is a control building framework for Script# and jQuery.

The goal of the project is to replicate the kind of reusability and encapsulation
that one would get using a library such as WPF, Java Swing, or WinForms, 
when building user interface controls in Script# with jQuery.

Features include:
 * Support for separation of logic from layout by using .html / .html.cs pairs
   and partial classes.
 * Support for locally-scoped CSS through CSS rewriting.
 * Support for locally-identified elements through ID rewriting.
 * Automatic binding of member fields to named elements.
 * Support for nested instantiations -- controls can declare instances of other controls.
 * Support for container controls and preservation of nested/inner content.
 * AddedToDocument & RemovedFromDocument events.
 * Replication of standard "mouse capture" behavior.

Detailed documentation is pending. In the mean time please inspect the example
code, or contact me on Twitter at @duckmaestro.
